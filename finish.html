                <h3> A major European club has reportedly joined Liverpool in the pursuit of Gavi, with the Barcelona star’s contract running down.</h3>

<br>Gavi spent time in the Real Betis academy before joining Barcelona’s youth setup in 2015. He rose through the ranks and made his senior debut for the Spanish outfit at the start of the current campaign.<br>

<br>The central midfielder has gone on to feature 39 times in all competitions so far this season. Xavi is giving the Spain international plenty of opportunities to impress, despite him being just 17 years old.<br>

<br>Gavi is looking to follow in the footsteps of team-mate and compatriot Pedri, who is regarded as one of the best youngsters in the world.<br>

<br>Gavi is certainly making a big impression himself and is earning comparisons with Xavi during the coach’s playing days.<br>

<br>The six-time international is also picking up transfer links with Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool. According to a recent report, the Reds are ‘ready to meet’ Gavi’s release clause.<br>
